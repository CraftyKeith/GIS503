<h2>Places I've Been</h2>
<p> I would like to think that I'm well travelled, but the problem is, every time you go somewhere new you realize how little you know and it makes you want to travel
  somewhere else. Heres the best and worst things of a few of the places I have been. </p><br>

  <ul>San Diego, California - Cool winters, too hot of summers.</ul></div>
<ul>Chicago, Illinois - Deep dish pizza, terribly cold winters.</ul>
<ul>Darwin, Australia - Food, limited accessibility in the city</ul>
<ul>Maco, Maldives - Beatiful place, conservative Muslim population doesnt like outsiders</ul>
<ul>Manama, Bahrain - Gold sheiks, not friendly to westerners</ul>
<ul>Jaco, Costa Rica - Pura Vida culture, not much to do outside of tourist activities</ul>
<ul>Lisbon, Portugal - Food and people, driving is a nightmare.<br>
