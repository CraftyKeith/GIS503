<h3>To-do before it's my time to go</h3>
<p> Everybody has a list of things they want to do or accomplish before they die. Even if it's a metaphorical list that includes exciting things like skydiving or paying off a mortgage.
I realized that if you don't take the time to think about it and write it down, you may never get anything done. I don't have the intention of living a boring unaccompished life. <br>
