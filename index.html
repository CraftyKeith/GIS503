    <p> This simple html website is about something I know a lot about. Me! For lack of other topics I want to elaborate on at any time this will be a simple get to know me.
    </p>
    <p>As you may know, I am a graduate student at the University of Washington - Tacoma, studying Geospatial Technologies. Outside of that, I work full time at the City of Kent
       in the GIS department, and I am a Navy Reservist. For the City of Kent I have mostly worked in asset management with the ESRI Collector App, collecting data for street sign inventory,
       and trying to organize the disarray of historical data. For the Navy, I am a Chief Petty Officer in a Coastal Riverine Squadron out of Bangor, WA. I work at least one weekend
       a month and two weeks a year with a handful of hours during the week attending conference calls or doing paperwork. I facilitate the unit physical fitness tests, as well as conduct
       navigation training to junior sailors as well as help plan and organiza our schedule with other senior leadership.<br>
</p>
       <p>I was born and raised in Tacoma but have moved around a lot and can't come to live anywhere but Cascadia. I hated the heat in San Diego and hated the winter in Chicago. I do enjoy
       the relatively stable weather of this region, even if it is all gray for eight months of the year.
